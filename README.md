# Comparing-Random-Forest-and-Keras-Models-on-a-Categorical-Dataset-with-Continuous-Target-Variable
This notebook compares a scikit-learn random forest model to a keras neural network on their ability to accurately preform regression on categorial features with a continous target. The notebook shows how features were created and adjusted for the models and shows scores of the models' performance.
